<h1>A Serverless Todo App</h1>

A simple todo notes app made with next.js using a serverless backend and redis datastore. <br>
Try it out at https://nextjs-serverless-todo-app.vercel.app/ <br>
~~Currently there is a slight issue where a refresh is needed to display newly added items (probably because of the latency between the backend and DB and the async fetch) will fix it sometime.~~ Fixed.

<h2>Running Locally</h2>
Do <code>npm run dev</code> from the project directory.<br>
You will need your own DB credentials when running locally.
